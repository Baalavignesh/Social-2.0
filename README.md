# newsocialmedia

A new Social Media.

## Getting Started

This is a new experience of Social Media Application. The concept of this Application is to meet people of your interest through online and contact then. Mainly during this Quarantine Lockdown period it’s hard to find people of your interest. Also this is the best opportunity for all those introverts out there to interact with people of their interest without hesitation. By signing up through this Application you can meet people of your interest, post images, chat with people, browse posts of people near you or post of your point of interest.

So, why Social 2.0 and not Instagram or Facebook. 

You don’t see unnecessary posts from people unless it is in your point of interest.
Privacy is assured 100%.
 Easy to find people near you. (A company for you to study, play games, go out, or even to talk and share stuff).
You can even hide your identity to talk to random people when you feel depressed or lonely. (will be launched in the second update).
Learn stuff from people who're there to help you out.

I am developing this Application in Flutter so it is available for both Android and IOS. Soon it will be coming to Desktop too(Web). And the data is stored in Firebase for retrieving data easily and quickly. All the data is encrypted and stored so nobody can steal the data. 

Technologies used : 
Flutter
Firebase
Node.js


Let's talk about the procedure of using the Application and signing up.  You sign in using your Email ID and a new password. After verifying the Mail sent to you, you can start using the Application. Initially we ask for all the points of interest and small information to get into the Application Quickly. After your inside, you can straight away look at people near you (Only district is shown to maintain your privacy). Send Friend requests, talk to them, like, comment to their post. The best part of the Application is the post that is being sent to you. While a person uploads a photo we will ask which category the photo being posted is about. Let’s demonstrate this with an example.

	Consider a person A with interest in Games and Coding. Another person B is having an interest in Coding and Books. If the person A and B are friends. While person A posting a photo
About a game with a point of interest as Gaming. Person 2 won’t receive that post since it doesn't come into the interest of person B. 

This Application is not clumsy with 1000 of posts which are not of your interest. This Application will keep expanding with features in future like stories, snaps, news, and more.
